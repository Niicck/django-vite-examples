# django-vite examples
Examples of how to use the new multi-app version of django-vite.

## Install

All of the example demos are on docker. Build the images with:

```bash
make build
```

## Examples

### [Legacy Settings](examples/legacy_settings/README.md)

```bash
make legacy-settings-demo
```

This demo runs django-vite using our legacy `DJANGO_VITE_*` settings. This is just to prove that backwards compatibility still works.

See: [settings.py](./examples/legacy_settings/django_app/settings.py)

### [New Settings](examples/new_settings/README.md)

```bash
make new-settings-demo
```

This demo shows how to run a single django-vite app using the new `DJANGO_VITE={...}` settings. Everything else in the setup is identical to the legacy-settings demo.

See: [settings.py](./examples/new_settings/django_app/settings.py)

### [Multi-App](examples/multi_app/README.md)

```bash
make build-multi-app-demo
```

```bash
make multi-app-demo
```

This demo shows how to use django-vite to load assets from 4 different vite apps.

- The **default** app is running on a vite dev server with `dev_mode=True`.
- **vite_app_1** app is also running on a vite dev server with `dev_mode=True`.
- **vite_app_2** app has already been compiled in a production build. Those assets are being served from the `STATIC_ROOT` with `dev_mode=False`.
- **vite_app_3** app has also been compiled in a production build. Those assets are being served from the `STATIC_ROOT` with `dev_mode=False`.

Noteworthy differences between the multi-app setup and the other demos:
- [settings.py](./examples/multi_app/django_app/django_app/settings.py) has the `DJANGO_VITE` settings that enable multiple apps.
- [index.html](./examples/multi_app/django_app/django_app/templates/index.html) shows how to load assets from multiple vite apps.
- [vite_app_1/vite.config.js](./examples/multi_app/vite_app_1/vite.config.js) shows how I'm using `static_url_prefix` for directing build output and dev server routing.

\*\*There's 1 bug I've found with this demo: I'm not able to make HMR work on 2 different vite dev servers if they're both trying to update assets on the same page. Only one vite app will get changes registered to it in real time. I'll keep investigating.
